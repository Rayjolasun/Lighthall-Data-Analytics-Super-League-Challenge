# Cell Referencing
The challenge was to test my ability in spreadsheet and to show how productive, accurate, and flexible I am in working with data.

## Problem Statement
Using Cell Referencing, write a formula that calculates and auto-populates a multiplication table into cell B2.

Use the fill handle in cell B2 to drag the formula across the entire multiplication table so it can auto-populate the cells

Replace the word ‘FORMULA’ in cell B2 with the correct formula that calculates the product of values in cells B1 and A2 then drag the fill handle to auto populate the rest of the cells in the multiplication table.

## Objective:

The objective of the task is to use cell referencing to create a multiplication table that automatically populates the cells. The task will require the use of the fill handle to copy the formula from cell B2 to the rest of the cells in the table.

## Here are the steps involved in completing the task:

* I Created a new Excel spreadsheet.
* Entered the values 1-12 in cells A2-A13 and values 1-12 in cells B1-M1
* In cell B2, entered the formula =$A2*B$1.
* Clicked and dragged the fill handle in cell B2 down to cell A13 and to cell M13.
* The multiplication table was automatically populated.

The formula in cell B2 uses cell referencing to calculate the product of the values in cells A2 and B1. The fill handle is then used to copy the formula to the rest of the cells in the table. This ensures that the table is automatically populated with the correct values.

## Conclusion:

The conclusion of the task is that a multiplication table has been created that automatically populates the cells. The table is created using cell referencing, which allows the formula to be copied from cell B2 to the rest of the cells. This makes the table easy to create and update, as the formula will automatically update when the values in cells B1 and A2 are changed.

The completion of this task demonstrates the ability to use cell referencing to create a multiplication table that automatically populates the cells. This is a valuable skill that can be used to automate tasks and save time.
