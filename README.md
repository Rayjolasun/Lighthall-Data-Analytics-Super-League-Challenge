# Lighthall-Data-Analytics-Super-League-Challenge
This is a repository for the Lighthall Data Analytics Super League Challenge (DASL_Challenge)

I am excited to have participated in the Data Analytics Super League (DASL1), a multi-level project-based competition where I tackled data analytics challenges to build my portfolio of projects and gain experience working in teams.

The Super League has 5 levels of challenges - 3 individual challenges and 2 team challenges. I am excited to work on real-world data analytics challenges and learn from other data analysts.
